This is a **Generative Adversarial Network (GAN)** which learns to predict the dynamics of a specific attractor. 
It is complementary to the other project related to the deep classifier of chaos and order (see the relevant repository on my Github), and is a first step towards the described future directions in the published paper of that project.
Such a GAN network can be used towards a deeper understanding of the statistical nature of chaotic dynamics, in particular the discreet time series exhibiting chaos.  

The code consistes of only one **Jupyter notebook**, and can be executed simply by running the notebook's cells. After training, the network is able to predict a realisation of the the (discreet) chaotic dynamics of the specific system.
